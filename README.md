# RIM Project 2

After originally trying to do Phaser and Node together, it didn't work out, so I bailed and did something else. I realized I wasn't getting anywhere trying to make Phaser work with Node (it even says on the npm page it was never meant to be used this way) and the source I found that looked most promising ended up using deprecated libraries and so did not work. I then switched over p2 (which phaser uses for physics) using a guide that i had found, but even that did not work.

In the end, I found something promising, but I was already late on the due date, and was falling behind in other classes and in working on the next project, so this will have to remain as is.

A struggle I found during following the guides was adapting the code to fit the eslint standards, but I'll chalk that up to poor time management and stress management. Trying to understand how they did what they did and referring to official documentation was a struggle as well, as I strained for time after oscilating between the direction I wanted to take the project.

Another thing I found disheartening was that p2 and Phaser weren't modular - I could download them from npm, but using them the way I've tried in class didnt seem to work. When coding for games and the such using Phaser, the standards are much more lax - mostly because beinng strict results in things breaking.
