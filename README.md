# RIM Project 2

After originally trying to do Phaser and Node together, it didn't work out, so I bailed and did something else. I realized I wasn't getting anywhere trying to make Phaser work with Node (it even says on the npm page it was never meant to be used this way) and the source I found that looked most promising ended up using deprecated libraries and so did not work.
